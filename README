xvg_animate
===========

Python utility to help creating time-lapse plotting of the content of .xvg-like files.

Usage
-----
Given by ./xvg_animate -h

Features
--------
- data can be read from several xvg files
- 1 or 2 (vertically stacked) plots can be produced
- data can be smoothed
- error margins can be plotted as shaded areas
- control of "time" step size
- outputs the frame rate to use to achieve a specified movie duration

Requirements
------------
- input files must not contained empty lines
- data in input files must be separated by tabulations and/or spaces

Warning
-------
- the script doesn't produce the movie for you, just pngs ready to be concatenated into a movie
- multiple y-axis on a plot are not handled
- transparent background can't be produced (they can... but it won't carry into the movie format)

To do
-----
- automatic setting of the y axis doesn't take into account error bars for now
